# Recommended Settings

I have included the server properties I will be using.

Here are the important settings:

* player-idle-timeout=10
* pvp=false
* max-world-size=29999984
* allow-flight=false
* spawn-animals=false

I highly recommend you change the server seed.

Also for Spigot, there are seeds in the spigot.yml. You should change those as well.
