		<h1>Protect Build Minecraft Server</h1>
		<h3>Server-IP:</h3>
		<p>
			<font color="red">Offline</font><br>
			Will be online for beta maybe Aug 20th
			<b>Schedule:</b><br>
			6PM - 12PM
		</p>
		<h2>What is it?</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Minecraft!!!</b><br>
			Ok what really is this?<br>
			A Minecraft server with grief <i>mitigation</i>.<br><br>
			Note that I italicize mitigation. It is hard to have the freedom of playing multiplayer vanilla Minecraft without a tradeoff with "grief security".<br><br>
			The core idea is that players should be able to build and have that build be off limits to other players.<br><br>
			One obvious problem is that you could build around a build and that sucks.<br>
			Teleportation will be added to mitigate trapping, but the actual result of this core idea is more so that players can adventure and build sealed off bases to store treasure.
		</p>
		<h2>World Files?</h2>
		<p>
			Once the server is out of funds and shuts down, the world files will be put here:<br>
