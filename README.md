# ProtectBuild
A Spigot Minecraft Plugin

This is how I run my "private" server for 6 hours a day on AWS.

First, the CloudWatch rule using the cron expression in cron.txt (in UTC).

Second, the lambda function that gets triggered in aws_lambda.py .

Third, the user data triggers schedule.py on the instance at every boot. The user data is in server_script.txt and schedule.py automates everything.

Note that schedule.py shutsdown the server (last line of code).

**Requirements**

Ngrok needs to be setup under the correct user and have the authentication token stored.

Python needs to have GitPython installed. The repo.zip should be the zip of a single branch clone of a repo that you don't mind force pushing to all the time. I have hardcoded to assume the folder that unzipping makes to be "ProtectBuild"; change this accordingly.
