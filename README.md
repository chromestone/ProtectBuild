# ProtectBuild
A Spigot Minecraft 1.14 Plugin

** This is currently in _BETA_. Use at your own risk. **

The goal is to _reduce_ griefing.

(Unfortunately there is a tradeoff between security and utility...)

## Features

* Registered players:
  * Requires a series of passphrases to log in.
  * Only registered players can do anything (period and literally).
* Players cannot destroy or interact with blocks placed by other players.
(With the exception of interacting with crafting and echanting tables.)
* Villager and wandering trader protection.
* Tree farm at spawn (to prevent tree griefing).
Saplings can only grow near spawn.
* Preventing all portal creation not from normal world.
* Set home and teleport home command.
* Teleport spawn command.
* Tnt does not explode.
* Lava buckets are not _placeable_ and not _dispensable_.
* Limits entity _spawning_ within a chunk based on number of entities that in chunk.
* Players instantly killed on attempting to cross worldborders.
* No enderdragons. (includes end crystal spawning)
* Automatically sets worldborders (for all dimensions).
* Spawn set to (0, 255, 0) for normal world.
* Spawn is on a stair at (0, 255, 0) and has a waterfall below.
* Automatically sets gamerules to prevent:
  * Fire does not spread.
  * Low max entity cramming to help reduce entity lag. (defaults to 4)
  * No mobs griefing. (includes Withers)

## Assumptions
The server is using the normal "3" world system. (You can disable nether or the end dimensions.)
